# TODO

Here is a list of things I have noticed are broken that I haven't got round to fixing. PRs welcome!

- [ ] Fix track selection highlighting
- [x] Fix playlist description text on light theme (maybe dark too?)
- [x] Fix Playlist number of hours text on light theme
- [ ] Edit Playlist modal save button
- [ ] Delete playlist modal
- [ ] Podcast episode times don't show up in Light theme (Spicetify css map doesnt have classes)
