# Koushi Theme

A light and dark minimalist theme for Spotify. Theme colours change according to the macOS system appearance. [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) is required to install. Supports the new Spotify Desktop UI. For the Classic Desktop UI go to the [legacy](https://github.com/yougotwill/Koushi/tree/legacy) branch.

The name comes from the Japanese word **格子**, which means lattice; latticework; window bars; grid; grating.
